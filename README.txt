Hi, this template was designed by Å½eka Andrikanic. Here is the link to his YouTube channel: " https://www.youtube.com/@FreelancerLifeStyle " 

This repository was created to show what programming languages and libraries I use.
All other repositories contain already compiled, minified, and ready-to-go websites or landing pages. 

To get started, you need to download the code. In the terminal write this comands by order:
1.<git init>   (It will take a little time to download the files)
2.<npm run dev>(This will run the code)

Or you can just take "dist" file and look on ready landing page.
